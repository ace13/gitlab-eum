Gitlab External User Manager
============================

Allows already registered users to create additional external users, to allow read/write access for repositories hosted on a GitLab instance without signup enabled.

## Development

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
